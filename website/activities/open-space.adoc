*OpenSpace* is a simple methodology for self-organizing conference tracks. It relies on participation by people who have a passion for the topics to be discussed. There is no preplanned list of topics, only time slots and a space in the main meeting room where interested participants propose topics and pick time slots.

**How OpenSpace Works:**

OpenSpace is a small set of rules that allow groups of people to interact in a simple, productive, organised way to create valuable dialogs that address the participants' most important issues.

The Fundamental "Rules" of the sessions that happen during OpenSpace conferences are:

* Whoever shows up is the right group

* Whatever happens is the only thing that could have

* Whenever it starts is the right time

* When it's over, it's over.

**To lead an OpenSpace Talk:**

* Come up with an interesting topic and title for your discussion.You don't need to develop these before the conference; most of the ideas will come to you during the event.

* Fill out a schedule on the white board for your topic.

* If you see topics that have something in common, consider combining them into a single time slot.

**A Note to Speaker:**   

As someone who often presents to groups, I find it easy to slip into lecturing mode. I resist this impulse, because that's not what OpenSpaces are about. General things to remember:

* This is a discussion, and you learn more in an OpenSpace from listening than by talking.

* If you're used to lecturing, pretend you're in the audience.

* Let go and let it happen. It will.

* Try not to control the conversation (if you've convened the session, "steering" is OK).   
When you do talk, know your audience and don't talk down to them. If people need clarification, they will ask for it.

* Just say it; try not to use the entertaining embellishments that you do for public speaking. Attendees are smart enough to get it unadorned.

* If you find yourself writing notes or flipcharts beforehand, step back and take a breath. You're probably preparing a lecture.

* If you absolutely must give an introduction, make it no longer than 5 minutes, and note it on the session announcement so that people can choose not to come until the discussion starts. If it's longer than 5 minutes, this probably isn't the right forum.
